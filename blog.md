Hey there! Welcome to my very first blog post on my shiny new portfolio website. I'm excited to kick things off by sharing a bit about myself, my journey, and what you can expect here.

## 🚀 A Quick Intro

I'm **Sukhan**, a developer passionate about blending creativity and technology. Whether it's coding, design, or exploring the latest tech trends—I'm all in!

When I'm not behind the keyboard, you might find me sketching art, wandering through nature, or sipping coffee while thinking about what to build next.

## 🌟 Why a Blog?

Writing is a fantastic way to organize thoughts, document learning, and share knowledge. Here, I'll regularly post about:

- Web Development & Creative Coding
- Cybersecurity Adventures
- Data Science & Machine Learning
- Project Showcases
- Tips and tutorials

Expect a mix of deep dives, quick tips, and personal reflections as I grow.

## 🧑‍💻 What's Coming Next?

I've got a few exciting topics lined up:

1. **How I secured my personal portfolio site**
2. **Building interactive experiences with Three.js**
3. **An introduction to ethical hacking and cybersecurity**
4. **Exploring machine learning from scratch**
